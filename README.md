# udeka!

This is a project which I am doing for my portfolio.

## Setting up

Get the source code using the following:

$ git clone https://github.com/parleychat/udeka.git

You will need to create a virtual environment:

```
$ virtualenv <env_name>
$ <env_name>\Scripts\activate
(Replace env_name with whatever you want to call it)
```

And then install all the necessary requirements using:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
The website should be running in your local network, so probably ```localhost:5000.```
