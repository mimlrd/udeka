udeka!

This is a project which I am doing for my portfolio.

Setting up

Get the source code using the following:

$ git clone https://www.github.com/ModoUnreal/dopenet.git
Once inside the dopenet directory you should probably set up a virtual environment:

$ virtualenv <env_name>
$ <env_name>\Scripts\activate
(Replace env_name with whatever you want to call it)

And then install all the necessary requirements using:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python dopenet.py
The website should be running in your local network, so probably localhost:5000.
